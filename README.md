# Reference Data Tool

A Tool to explore reference Data in QRadar, this includes refmaps which can't be viewed in the interface currently.

Copy folder to /opt/qradar/www then open the <console IP>/refSetTool

Probably won't work in Internet Explorer 

All links to 3rd party js libs are via CDNs, if your qradar console is not connected to the internet you will need to manually download them and link them in each html file, email me if you are having issues (craig.roberts@uk.ibm.com)

This was made by IBM QRadar Lab Services, if you need help with your qradar deployment, integration, tuning, incident response or scaling/arcitecture - please feel free to reach out.
